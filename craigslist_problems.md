# Craigslist Problems

 Common Craigslist problems are being "flagged" or "ghosted". Flagging is when a Craigslist viewer marks your ad as "Prohibited". Ghosting is when a Craigslist robot detects your ad as being against the rules and makes it invisible. Craigslist does not disclose the reason for removal. This page will describe common reasons for an ad being flagged or ghosted.

 ##Causes
This may occur for any of the following reasons:
- Posting identical content within 48 hours
- Posting content in multiple cities (even if the content is different)
- Posting any two ads within the same hour (time period varies by city)
- Reusing the same title for multiple ads
- Posting too many ads in a single day (limit varies per city)
- Posting from a foreign country, state, or city (e.g. using foreign employees or posting while you are on vacation)
- Using words that hint of scam, such as "free", "credit card", "dating", etc.
- Using photos that are irrelevant to the ad
- Posting an ad with no photos
- Writing an ad that is "too commercial" - Craigslist doesn't define this, but to avoid this you can try:
     - Using the Craigslist email relay
     - Avoid using logos in the photos
     - Start the ad with facts, instead of starting with romantic or poetic writing about the property

##User Flagging
Although we may not agree with their reasons, Craigslist viewers have reported flagging ads for the following reasons:
- Disgruntled tenant, former employee, or competitor
- Overusing scammy words (such as "free" or "deal" making the ad seem too good to be true
- Missing phone number or email address
- Too many large paragraphs in an ad
- Not enough factual or critical information, or this information is hard to find
- Ad looks like a generic template
- Ad is for a whole property instead of a specific unit
- Looks like a big company (even if you are a big company)
- Use of HTML, such as bold or underlined text (even though this is allowed)
- Not allowing email responses

##Malicious Flagging
Any user on Craigslist can flag an ad as "prohibited" for any reason. The purpose of the "prohibited" button is to keep Craigslist free of scams, however, this button may be used maliciously. It could be an upset tenant, a former employee, the competition, or anyone else with any motive. It is very difficult to prove if someone is doing this. You may wish to take the following steps to respond to malicious flagging:
- Make your ads hard to find (go incognito)
     - Remove the property name from ads
     - Remove the address (except on the map)
     - Change the phone number format (e.g. 555 555 1234 instead of (555) 555-1234)
     - Remove text which is unique to your company (e.g. "Enjoy our famous elephant-shaped swimming pool)

##Next Steps
After an ad has been flagged, take the following precautions to prevent this from reoccurring in the future:
- Stop posting for at least two days (more is better, if possible)
- Post fewer ads each day
- Leave more time between posting each ad
- Ensure that you are following all the steps mentioned above

Rooof has settings that can help you avoid being flagged. In the settings page, select "**Show Optional Settings**", and scroll down to the Posting Reminders section. There is a setting which has Rooof remind you to leave a certain amount of time between each post.
