2. **New Tab** - If you want to open a new tab, click the small square beside your last open tab.
3. **URL Bar** - This is where you type in web addresses. In Chrome, you can also search on Google by typing in this bar.
4. **Bookmark Bar** - These are bookmarks that are available for easy access. The bar is displayed on each tab. Clicking one of the bookmarks will take you to that page. If you do not see the bookmark bar, do not worry, you may just have it turned off.<br>
