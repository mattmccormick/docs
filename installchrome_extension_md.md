After you click "**Save**", Rooof will check your Craigslist credentials. You will see pop-ups in the bottom right corner - this is the posting tool working. You will be able to see Rooof working right before your eyes. Try not to click in the tab where Rooof is working but feel free to work in other tabs while you wait. A pop-up will notify you when it is done.

Note: If you enter incorrect credentials, you will get this message...

If this happens, click "**OK**" and do the following:
* Check that you entered your credentials correctly, or
* Reset your password
